# SAWaterLevel

This iOS application is intended to educate users in the San Antonio, TX area about current water conditions and what applicable rules and restrictions are in effect based upon its current level.

This app was originally developed by [Wayne Hartman](http://waynehartman.com) and [Douglas Mendiz√°bal](https://github.com/dmend?tab=activity) as part of the 2014 [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://hackforchange.org/).
