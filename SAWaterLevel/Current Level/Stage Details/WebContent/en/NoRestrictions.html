        <p>Year-Round watering restrictions (listed below) are in effect when the Edwards Aquifer level is above 660 feet mean sea level at the monitored well. These rules continue until there is an announcement in the newspaper that Stage 1 is in effect.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All fountains &mdash; whether commercial or residential, or indoor or outdoor &mdash; are allowed.</li>
            <li>Landscape watering with an irrigation system or sprinkler is permitted any day of the week before 11 a.m. or after 7 p.m.</li>
            <li>Hand watering with a hand-held hose, drip irrigation, soaker hose or bucket is permitted any time of day.</li>
            <li>Washing impervious cover such as parking lots, driveways, streets or sidewalks is permitted without runoff to avoid water waste.</li>
            <li>Hand watering with a hand-held hose, drip irrigation or bucket is permitted any time of day.</li>
            <li>Water waste is prohibited at all times. Allowing water to run off into a gutter, ditch, or drain or failing to repair a controllable leak is considered water waste.</li>
            <li>Residential, commercial, industrial and agricultural Edwards Aquifer water users should use common sense and best practices to avoid water waste.</li>
